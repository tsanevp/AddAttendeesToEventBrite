# Automating Adding Attendees To Your Event In Eventbrite

DISCLAIMER: This script is 
EventBrite is a great package for managing your Ignite. It allows you to sell tickets (either paid or free) and check people in using their free iPhone/Android app.

One major pain is that there's no easy Import function to add attendees. If you have a long list of attendees to add, it's time-consuming and error-prone.

This script automates the process, so you can easily import multiple attendees to your guest list.

#### Before you get started

1) Log into your EventBrite account and open up the event that you wish to add people to. Note its `eid` value, which will be shown in the URL, eg https://www.eventbrite.com/myevent?eid=123456

2) Hit the Add Attendees option (on the lower-left of the Manage page) then use your browser's Developer Tools to note the ID of the ticket type that you wish to create.

3) Install the Selenium python plugin from https://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/

#### Update the script

Enter your EventBrite login and password in the relevant sections.

Add your attendees to a tab-limited textfile in the format `firstname <tab> surname <tab> email_address` and update the `attendeeList` variable to point to this.

Update the `eventID` and `ticketID` sections with the values you determined in (1) and (2) above.

#### Run the Python script

This should open a Firefox browser, log into your event, and add the names from the textfile to the ticket type that you've chosen.
